## DAC(Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Load Scheduling)

***

- For Windows,run start_windows.py
- For Linux,run start_linux.py

#### <b>Note</b>:
- Look in the start files on how to terminate the background processes after work is over
- I used conda environment to run files,hence used python in start files.If you are using normal python from the system,change it to python3
- Add required print statements in the programs and they will be collected in the files under logs directory
